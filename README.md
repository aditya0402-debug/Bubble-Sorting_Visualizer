# Bubble-Sorting-Visualizer
Software provinding a visually appealing representation of the Bubble sorting algorithm

Here, I have developed a sorting visualizer using Data Structures and Algorithms principles, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive user interface.
I have implemented random array generation to generate random arrays upto size 300 and to display the Bubble Sorting Algorithm in O(n2).

You can use the Generate New Array button to generate any new array with completely random values.
The '+' button can be used to increase the size of the array.
Bubble Sort can be visualized by clicking on the Bubble Sort Button.
I have also used different frequency notes which make the visualization more appealing.
